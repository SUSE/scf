Cloud Controller now requires SSL configuration with the following
properties, the CA cert should match the diego bbs ca cert and that ca
cert should be used to sign the newly required public cert:

cc.mutual_tls.ca_cert: PEM-encoded CA certificate for secure, mutually authenticated TLS communication
cc.mutual_tls.public_cert: PEM-encoded certificate for secure, mutually authenticated TLS communication
cc.mutual_tls.private_key: PEM-encoded key for secure, mutually authenticated TLS communication


cc.mutual_tls.ca_cert
cc.mutual_tls.public_cert
cc.mutual_tls.private_key
